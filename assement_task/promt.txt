I wrote this Pygame code to implement the A* algorithm as an assignment for a course on algorithms. The code generates a random maze and places a blue dot to represent the goal and a green dot to represent the agent. It then utilizes the A* algorithm to find the optimal path and moves the agent through the maze towards the goal.

The code works, but it is kind of a mess in terms of formatting. Please could you help me refactor the code to align with better programming practices? I would like to implement a Class based approach for better organization. Include a class Maze, a class Agent, a class MazeGenerator, and a class Pathfinding. Use the dataclass library. Remove the print statements I've previously added for debugging, and include comments and docstrings to improve readability and maintainability of the code. I would also like the maze walls to be brown instead of black.
